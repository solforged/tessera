## Unreleased

### Fixed

- New typed notes use the submitted title, even when an earlier title matched an existing note.
- New typed notes appear in Merge into and show their ID and creation date without a reload.
- Opening a blank note no longer adds a stored blank block.
- Gloss keeps its standfirst styling when a page is revisited through Find.
- Source metadata visibility survives reloads without following an unrelated field's caret.

## 0.3.0, 2026-10-12

### Added

- Pairing and sync between a Mac and an Android phone on a tailnet, with status in the rail and in Settings.
- An Android app for reading, capture and EPUB import. An unpaired phone keeps its own notebook.
- Library browsing: a cover shelf, collections, metadata filters, person pages and a highlights desk in reading order.
- A note index, aliases, finding aids and note headers.
- Paged reading, spreads, a contents margin, chapter maps and touch controls.
- FSRS scheduling, card templates on types, descriptor cards and grade undo.
- Journal days with a period trail, overview tiles and a folded agenda.
- A global capture line on macOS, and notebook switching in the app.
- Agent tools for tasks, cards, queries, the library and sync.

### Fixed

- Outline editing, references, fold motion and conflict display on desk and cover screens.
- Library, review and reader layout on narrow screens.
- Sync status is a bare glyph beside the wordmark, with a state-and-hint slip on pointer hover or keyboard focus. Click or tap opens its summary; the cover row appears only for waiting or action states.

## 0.2.0, 2026-10-08

First published release. It included the macOS app with signed updates, the Linux command line and the browser demo.
