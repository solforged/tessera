# Tessera

Tessera is a local-first outline workstation for notes, questions, evidence, tasks and study. You write in an outline of small addressable blocks. Each block is one tile; pages, journals, agendas, investigations and review sessions are different ways of arranging the same tiles.

Status: design. No application code exists yet. This repository starts from a design written after several months of prototyping, so the first commits are documents.

## What it is for

- **Writing in outlines.** Nest, move, fold and zoom blocks with the keyboard or the mouse. Vim users get real Vim motions inside a block and structural commands across blocks.
- **Reusing thoughts without copying them.** A reference shows the original block's current text. Editing the original updates every place it appears.
- **Questions that change their answers.** An investigation keeps its dated assessments. Accepting a new answer supersedes the old one without erasing it.
- **Several accounts of one thing.** Sources, passages and attributed positions stay distinct, so disagreement is visible instead of averaged away.
- **Work and study attached to knowledge.** Tasks, schedules and flashcards live on the blocks they concern, with their history intact.
- **Agents as ordinary clients.** Command-line tools and language-model agents use the same checked operations as the editor. They never write to the database directly.

## Principles

1. Never lose work. Unsaved, saved, conflicted and superseded are different states, and the interface says which one applies.
2. Identity outlives wording. Moving, editing or referencing a block keeps its ID, its cards and its history.
3. Structure is added, not chosen up front. A block can gain a task, a question, a card or a type without becoming a different object.
4. Don't drop a frame. Typing, scrolling and navigation have explicit budgets, measured on large notebooks.
5. Dark, quiet and keyboard-first, with every action also reachable by a visible control.

- [Vision](docs/vision.md): who it is for and what it must do.
- [Lessons](docs/lessons.md): what the prototype proved and what it got wrong.
- [Domain model](docs/domain-model.md): blocks, capabilities and their rules.
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): runtime, editor, storage and sync decisions.
- [Performance](docs/performance.md): budgets, the measured baseline and the spikes that decide the stack.
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md): build order and exit criteria.

## Acknowledgments

Tessera borrows ideas from tools and thinkers its author admires:

- **Outliners with addressable blocks**, such as Logseq, Roam Research, RemNote, and Tana: outline-first writing, journal days, block references and backlinks.
- **org-mode and org-roam:** scheduled and deadline dates, repeaters, an agenda and clocked work connected to notes.
- **Vannevar Bush's memex:** associative trails that keep the context of discovery close.
- **SuperMemo and SM-2,** and **Anki's** four-grade review.
